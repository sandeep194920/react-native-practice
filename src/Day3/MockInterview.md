## Tips for Success

### Before Starting
1. Read the brief carefully
2. Ask clarifying questions (even if just to yourself)
3. State your approach before coding
4. Break down the task into steps

### While Coding
1. Think out loud constantly
2. Explain WHY not just WHAT
3. Handle edge cases as you go
4. Test frequently, not just at the end

### Example Narration
Instead of silence, say:
> "I'm creating a state for the data array... Now I'm setting up the
> fetch function inside useEffect so it runs on mount... I'm using
> try-catch-finally to handle errors properly and ensure loading is
> always turned off... Now I'm adding keyExtractor to the FlatList
> which is critical for React to track items efficiently..."

### If You Get Stuck
1. Talk through the problem out loud
2. Break it into smaller pieces
3. Try the simplest solution first
4. Don't panic - thinking is part of the process

### Time Management
- **Don't** spend 40 minutes perfecting one task
- **Do** move on if you're stuck
- **Do** leave time to test everything
- **Do** finish with a working solution, even if simple

   - Which tasks took too long?
   - Where did you get stuck?
   - What concepts felt unclear?

3. **Action items:**
   - Which task to practice again?
   - Which pattern to review?
   - What to focus on next time?

## Real Interview Differences

Your actual TopTal interview will be similar but:
- ✅ Real interviewer watching and listening
- ✅ They may ask follow-up questions
- ✅ They may give hints if stuck
- ✅ They may ask you to explain trade-offs
- ✅ They may ask "what if" scenarios

Practice responding to:
- "Why did you choose that approach?"
- "How would this scale with 10,000 items?"
- "What if the API was slow?"
- "How would you test this?"
- "What would you do differently in production?"

## Good Luck!

Remember:
- You've practiced these patterns multiple times
- You understand the concepts
- You can explain your decisions
- You're ready! 💪

**The interviewer wants to see:**
1. Technical competence ✅
2. Clear communication ✅
3. Problem-solving approach ✅
4. Professional demeanor ✅

You've got all of these! Go crush it! 🚀
